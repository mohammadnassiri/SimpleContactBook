# Contacts Book Based on React and Django
This is a simple contacts book based on django's restframework and React. It uses CRUD to make connection between backend and frontend.

## Setup
You can simply run the project with docker:
```
docker-compose -d up
```
Then create superuser and database:
```
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

To insert some data in your database you can use the below script.  
It requires a parameter and will generates as many contacts you have entered in the superuser's book with faker library.
```
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py generate_contacts 10
```
## Manual Setup
If you don't like docker, first change proxy in package.json and CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST in django settings. You must replace ```http://backend:8000``` to ```http://localhost:8000```.

Then please use below commands to run the project. Please be sure to run django under 8000 and react under 3000 ports.
```
cd contact_book
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py generate_contacts 10
python manage.py runserver
```
```
cd contact_book_ui
npm install
npm start
```

**Notice:** Please delete db.sqlite3 if you have used docker to start the project and want to try manual setup.

## Use
Now you can go to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 in your browser to see the project.  
Just enter a username and password to login or register(if username not exists).  
When you add your first contact, a book will be created automatically.
